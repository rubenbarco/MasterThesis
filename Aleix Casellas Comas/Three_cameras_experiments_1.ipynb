    "In this notebook there are done the experiments explained in the document related with the three views settings, for the first person, i.e the one placed at the left of the HC view. We will first detect and remove the outliers, then compute the baseline error and finally compute the 3D space using the differents methods described. We are going to use segments of 10 frames of different videos, which we have previously annotated the ground truth. We will do first th experiments for the body, and then for the hand."

Point1 is going to be associated with view HC, point2 to N1 and point3 to Z1. You have to comment or uncomment depending on the subjects you want to make the experiments on.
