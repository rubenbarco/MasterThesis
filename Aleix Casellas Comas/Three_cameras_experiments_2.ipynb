    "This notebook is going to be pretty much the same that the notebook *Three_cameras_experiments_1*, but we will do the experiments for the person 2, i.e the one located at the right if we look from the HC camera. All the process and functions are going to be pretty much the same. It is just going to change some notation, and the matrices of intrinsic and extrinsic parameters that we use. So all the comments are made in the other notebook."
